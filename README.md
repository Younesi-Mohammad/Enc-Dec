# Enc-Dec
This is a simple program in C for encryption and decryption. The algorithm uses an incrementing counter to encrypt each character similar to the Counter (CTR) mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm. The program output the result (either the ciphertext or the plaintext) to the screen.
